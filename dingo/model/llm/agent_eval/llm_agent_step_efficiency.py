Analyze the agent's execution trace and identify:

- **Wasted steps**: Redundant, repeated, or unnecessary steps
- **Loops detected**: Whether the agent got stuck in a repetitive pattern

A score of 10 means perfectly efficient execution with no wasted steps.
A score of 0 means the agent was completely stuck in loops or took entirely unnecessary actions.
