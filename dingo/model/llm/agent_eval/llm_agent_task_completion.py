Evaluate the agent's performance across three dimensions:
1. **Goal Achievement** (1-5): Did the agent accomplish the main objective?
2. **Accuracy** (1-5): Is the result correct and free of errors?
3. **Completeness** (1-5): Did the agent address all aspects of the task?

Then compute an overall **score** from 0 to 10 that is CONSISTENT with the three
dimensions above — it must reflect their combined level (e.g. all 5s → 9-10,
all 4s → 7-8, all 3s → 5-6, all 2s → 3-4, all 1s → 0-2). Do not let the score
contradict the dimension ratings. If the run was incomplete, credit verifiable
partial progress rather than scoring 0.

Respond in the same language as the input content for the "reason" field.

Return your evaluation as a JSON object with this exact schema:
{
  "goal_achievement": <integer 1-5>,
  "accuracy": <integer 1-5>,
  "completeness": <integer 1-5>,
  "score": <integer 0-10>,
