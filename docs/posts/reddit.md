# ÊñáÊ°àÂõõ - Dingo √ó ArtiMuse Integration

### For r/MachineLearning

**Title**: [P] Automated aesthetic evaluation pipeline for AI-generated images using Dingo √ó ArtiMuse integration

We built an automated pipeline to systematically evaluate AI-generated image quality beyond simple "does it work?" testing.

### The Problem:
Most AI image generation evaluation focuses on technical metrics (FID, CLIP scores) but lacks systematic aesthetic assessment that correlates with human perception. Teams often rely on manual review or basic quality gates, making it difficult to scale content production or maintain consistent aesthetic standards.

### Our Approach:
**Automated Aesthetic Pipeline:**
- **nano-banana** generates diverse style images
- **ArtiMuse** provides 8-dimensional aesthetic analysis
- **Dingo** orchestrates the entire evaluation workflow with configurable thresholds

**ArtiMuse's 8-Dimensional Framework:**
1. **Composition**: Visual balance and arrangement
2. **Visual Elements**: Color harmony, contrast, lighting
3. **Technical Execution**: Sharpness, exposure, details
4. **Originality**: Creative uniqueness and innovation
5. **Theme Expression**: Narrative clarity and coherence
6. **Emotional Response**: Viewer engagement and impact
7. **Gestalt Completion**: Overall visual coherence
8. **Comprehensive Assessment**: Holistic evaluation

### Evaluation Results:
**Test Dataset**: 20 diverse images from nano-banana
**Performance**: 75% pass rate (threshold: 6.0/10)
**Processing Speed**: 6.3 seconds/image average
**Quality Distribution**:
- High scores (7.0+): Clear composition, natural lighting, rich details
- Low scores (<6.0): Over-stylization, poor visual hierarchy, excessive branding

### Example Findings:
üåÉ **Night cityscape (7.73/10)**: Excellent layering, dynamic lighting, atmospheric details
üë¥ **Craftsman portrait (7.42/10)**: Perfect focus, warm storytelling, technical precision
üêª **Cute sticker (4.82/10)**: Clean execution but lacks visual depth and narrative
üìä **Logo design (5.68/10)**: Functional but limited artistic merit

### Technical Implementation:
- **ArtiMuse**: Trained on ArtiMuse-10K dataset (photography, painting, design, AIGC)
- **Scoring Method**: Continuous value prediction (Token-as-Score approach)
- **Integration**: RESTful API with polling-based task management
- **Output**: Structured reports with actionable feedback

### Applications:
- **Content Production**: Automated quality gates for publishing pipelines
- **Brand Guidelines**: Consistent aesthetic standards across teams
- **Creative Iteration**: Detailed feedback for improvement cycles
- **A/B Testing**: Systematic comparison of generation parameters

**Code**: https://github.com/MigoXLab/dingo

### For r/artificial

**Title**: Beyond technical metrics: Building systematic aesthetic evaluation for AI-generated images

Sharing our experiment in automated aesthetic assessment that goes beyond traditional image quality metrics.

### Background:
While technical metrics like FID and CLIP scores are useful, they don't capture the aesthetic qualities that determine whether AI-generated images are actually usable for content production, marketing, or creative work.

### The Challenge:
Most teams evaluate AI-generated images through:
- Manual review (subjective, doesn't scale)
- Basic technical metrics (resolution, file size)
- Simple pass/fail rules (faces detected, appropriate aspect ratio)

None of these approaches capture the aesthetic nuances that make images compelling to human viewers.

### Our Solution:
We built an integrated pipeline combining **nano-banana** image generation, **ArtiMuse** aesthetic evaluation, and **Dingo** workflow orchestration.

**Key Innovation - 8-Dimensional Aesthetic Framework:**
Instead of a single quality score, ArtiMuse breaks down aesthetics into measurable components:
- Composition and visual flow
- Technical execution quality
- Emotional impact and storytelling
- Originality and creative merit

**Training Approach:**
- **Dataset**: ArtiMuse-10K with expert annotations across diverse content types
- **Method**: Continuous scoring rather than categorical classification
- **Validation**: High correlation with human aesthetic preferences

### Real-World Results:
**Pipeline Performance**:
- 75% pass rate at 6.0/10 threshold
- 6.3s average processing time per image
- Detailed reasoning for each score dimension

**Quality Insights**:
- **High performers**: Clear subject matter, natural lighting, balanced composition
- **Common failures**: Over-stylization, poor visual hierarchy, excessive text/branding
- **Edge cases**: Artistic styles that challenge conventional aesthetic standards

### Practical Applications:
1. **Content Pipelines**: Automated screening before human review
2. **Parameter Optimization**: Systematic evaluation of generation settings
3. **Quality Assurance**: Consistent standards across different content creators
4. **User Experience**: Better content recommendations based on aesthetic quality

### Open Questions:
- How do aesthetic preferences vary across cultural contexts?
- Can we predict long-term aesthetic trends from current evaluation data?
- What's the optimal balance between artistic innovation and broad appeal?

This represents a step toward more human-aligned AI evaluation. Instead of optimizing purely for technical metrics, we can start optimizing for the qualities that actually matter to end users.
