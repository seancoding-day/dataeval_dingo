Which is why the holiday season is particularly wonderful since people open more bubble, even though I firmly believe bubbles should be enjoyed frequently just because it's Tuesday, for example. Tonight we tried the Segura Viudas Brut Cava which retails for around $9.\n1.) Hosting a big holiday party this year? This budget Cava is wallet friendly and crowd-pleasing.\n3.) Cava in general, and the Segura Viudas Brut in particular, offers a lot of bang for your buck.\n4.) I'd serve the Segura Viudas with my cheese plate this Thanksgiving.\nOn the nose I got a waxy note, pepper, flowers, and lemon. In the mouth I found peach, orange peel and melon. The wine had long-lasting bubbles and good acidity.", "source": "c4", "readability": 3, "professionalism": 1, "cleanliness": 4, "reasoning": 1}
{"id": "BkiUdQE241xg-Ma3xU7N", "content": "There are a number of Permanent Orienteering Courses (POCs) in Sussex, which can be used to practise on. Whatever your level of experience and fitness, you can devise an activity to suit you using a permanent orienteering course. Add interest to a family walk, explore a site during your holidays or give a fresh challenge to a training run.\nMaps are available for these courses, which show the location of around 20 controls. A number of possible courses have been suggested at the bottom of each map, however there is nothing to stop you starting from wherever you wish and visiting whichever controls you want in any order.\nThe controls are marked by square plaques split into one red and one white triangle. Most of these are fixed to posts, benches or trees. On each plaque is a number corresponding to that marked on the map, also on the plaque is a unique letter. Noting down this letter provides proof that you have visited the control. On the map is a series of boxes, one for each control. Each box contains the number of the control, a description of its location and a space into which to copy the letter from the plaque..\nAll of Southdowns Orienteers' Permanent Orienteering Courses are currently (Autumn 2017-Summer 2018) undergoing a vigorous programme of checking, revision and refurbishment. As maps and courses are revised, this page will be with detailed information about how to obtain a map and gain access to the area.\nMaps can be downloaded free of charge from Brighton and Hove City Council.\nThe following sites are undergoing revision and repair during Spring 2018 and we expect them to be available for use very shortly. In the meantime please check with Ed Forman (SO POC Co-ordinator) before visiting the locations.\nThe following sites have slightly older courses where there may be some map updates required or controls missing. There is an ongoing programme of work to look at regenerating these courses where feasible.\nMaps available from Mole Valley Orienteering Club.\nVisit British Orienteering for more information about permanent orienteering courses nationwide.", "source": "c4", "readability": 4, "professionalism": 1, "cleanliness": 5, "reasoning": 1}

{"id": "BkiUdRI5qdmC92mfkoma", "content": "(Host) Based on nearly complete campaign results, Secretary of State Deb Markowitz says Michael Badamo has almost certainly won the Progressive gubernatorial nomination. Badamo easily defeated Peter Diamondstone, and a write in effort to block Badamo was not successful.\n(Kinzel) Although the official election results will not be certified until next Monday, it's virtually certain that the Progressive Party will have a gubernatorial candidate on the ballot this fall.\nThere were two candidates running in the Party's primary for governor: Michael Badamo and Peter Diamondstone. But some Party leaders wanted to leave the office empty so that most of the Party's resources could be directed to Anthony Pollina's campaign for lieutenant governor.\nTo achieve that goal, they needed to mount an aggressive write-in campaign for a candidate who would then decline the Party's nomination. But in the end, that didn't happen.\nTurnout in the Progressive primary was very light \u2013 just over 1,000 people voted in their election. Badamo received roughly 70% of the vote; Diamondstone about 30%; and there were several hundred write-in votes, but not enough to affect the outcome of the race.\n(Kinzel) Markowitz says she is very pleased that no voter access complaints have been received by her office for the primary election.", "source": "c4", "readability": 5, "professionalism": 1, "cleanliness": 5, "reasoning": 2}
